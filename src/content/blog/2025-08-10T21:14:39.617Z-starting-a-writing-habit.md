I've never had a writing habit, but after seeing [Dantas](https://github.com/gustav0d) create his own blog to document his learning process, post weekly updates, and talk about things in general, I felt a weird desire to create my own.

While I may not have many life stories to share, I believe that writing things down is the best way to solidify what I learn, so I'll do it.

I don't expected anyone to read or follow what I write here. My goal is to document my journey, what I've learned, discoveries and the course of my career.

Anyway, I just finished a project where I built a simple URL shortener using Spring Boot. This project's main focus was not the API per se, but rather the experience of deploying it on AWS. I don't know much about Terraform (yet!), so I configured everything using the AWS console.

I won't go into too much detail about the project in this post, as I've already documented the entire process and plan to write a dedicated article about it soon.

That's all for now.
