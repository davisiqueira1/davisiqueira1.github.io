## 0. Introduction

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is an AWS service that provides a way to manage and build virtual private networks. With it, we can integrate a variety of resources (such as EC2 instances, RDS, EFS, etc.) and define how they communicate with each other.

Before VPCs, networking in the cloud was abstract and limited. With VPC, we gain full control over IP addressing, routing, and security rules, just like in a traditional on-premises data center.

In this article, we'll explore a series of resources that AWS provides to set up our own virtual network, and we'll also discover how they interact with each other to make everything work.
